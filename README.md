This is working demo for Availity's coding assignment.

## Installation
Please install in two directories as I had set this up as a fullstack project.
Npm install in the server directory as well as the healthcare directory.
```bash
npm install
cd healthcare -> npm install 
```
## Usage
In the server directory run the following command: 

```bash
npm run dev
```
