# availity
This is working demo for Availity's coding assignment.

## Installation
Please install in two directories as I had set this up as a fullstack project.
Npm install in the server directory as well as the healthcare directory.
```bash
npm install
cd healthcare -> npm install 
```
## Usage
In the server directory run the following command: 

```bash
npm run dev
```
I would like to thank the Availity team for this opportunity to try these excercises out and given more time I beleive I could've done even more. This was due to the time constraints I had on my end, and was only able to work on this for about 1 day.  Please let me know if there are any improvements to be made so I can learn from my mistakes.
## Questionaire From Homework Assignment
1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can be a personal or school
project.

   a. My proudest professional achievment would have to be fixing all the production errors for the entire Agent Portal for Florida Blue. This endeavour allowed me to take more of a leadership role with software development and allowed me to experience Node.js. Another proud achievement is creating a couple of components on Agent Portal that is heavily used by our Agents as shown by Google Analytics.
 2. Tell me a about a book, blog, article or GitHub repo you read or liked recently, and why
you like it and why you should recommend I do the same.

   A. I've recently picked up Effective C++ by Scott Meyers since I'm always looking to improve my skills as software developer. Even though that C++ doesnt really have a place in my current tech. stack ( MERN) , knowing the fundamentals of C++ helps one understand programming in general and I beleive it helps round me out as a developer as well as fill in gaps of knowledge that I may not have understood about JavaScript. Another thing I've been doing is doing Udemy courses to practice a full stack website,since I am very tactile learner and having a guide to follow alongs helps me understand what I'm doing. I highly reccomend Steven Grider's  Node with React: Full Stack Web Development as it has accelrated my progess with Node and full-stack programming and it can help anyone looking to improve their skills .
 3. If you were to describe to a 7-year old what Availity does, what would you say?
 
 a. If I were to explain what availity does to a 7 year old , I would simply say: " Availity helps people track their money , so that that they don't lose it and make sure that they're using it well.
 ## Note
You may see some changes, but I am working on them  personally. They are mainly on the csvPractice.js file for the third programming excercise. I'm doing them since I like seeing projects completed from end to end, as well as get more practice doing Full-Stack Work. My current plan is to get the CSV to work in the front end and migrate it the logic to backend if possible. However , at the time of submission , only the first two excercises were fully completed.
