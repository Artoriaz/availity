# availity
This is working demo for Availity's coding assignment.

## Installation
Please install in two directories as I had set this up as a fullstack project.
Npm install in the server directory as well as the healthcare directory.
```bash
npm install
cd healthcare -> npm install 
```
## Usage
In the server directory run the following command: 

```bash
npm run dev
```
I would like to thank the Availity team for this opportunity to try these excercises out and given more time I beleive I could've done even more. This was due to the time constraints I had on my end, and was only able to work on this for about 1 day.  Please let me know if there are any improvements to be made so I can learn from my mistakes.
